# FPN-ASPP-semantic-segmentation
This is FPN-ASPP for real time semanti segmentation
This is the source code for semantic segmentation. Our source code 
implementation of semantic segmentation method uses the integration 
of deep plab architecture and FPN ideas. Deplab architecture has the 
ability of multi-sensory vision, but it consumes computing time. FPN 
has the ability to transform low-level semantics into high-level 
semantics, and saves computing time. Using the advantages of both, 
we propose this method.
